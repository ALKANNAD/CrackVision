Crack Classification Models

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for crack classification using various deep learning models.

Notebooks:

•
CrackclassificationInceptionV3withMETUmodel.ipynb: Crack classification using InceptionV3 model with METU dataset.

•
CrackclassificationRESENT50withMETUmodel.ipynb: Crack classification using ResNet50 model with METU dataset.

•
CrackclassificationXceptionwithMETUmodel.ipynb: Crack classification using Xception model with METU dataset.

Dataset:

The notebooks are designed to work with the METU dataset. Please ensure you have the dataset available in the appropriate directory as referenced in the notebooks.

Usage:

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Scikit-image) installed. You can open each .ipynb file in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

Contributing:
